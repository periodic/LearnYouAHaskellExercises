## 2. Starting Out

1. Fizz-Buzz:  Take all the integers from 1 to 100, inclusive, and write a list comprehension replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "fizz", numbers divisible by 5 with "buzz" and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "fizzbuzz".  You can use the function `show` to convert a number into a string.
2. Write a function that given a list of integers, `nums`, finds all the pairs in the list that sum to some target number `target` and returns then as a list of tuples.  You can use a list comprehension for this, write a recursive function or just write an expression for it.  One helpful function is `tails` that you can get by importing the `Data.List` package.  So `sumPairs 61 [1, 10, 51, 31, 83] == [(10,51)]`.
3. Self-Excluded Product: Given a list of integers, `nums`, create a list where every element is the product of `nums` omitting the element in `nums` with the same index.  So `sep [1, 5, 3] == [15, 3, 5]`.  Assume that all the numbers are non-zero.  If you want a challenge, adapt it to account for zero elements.  A useful function is `product` which computes the product of a list of numbers.
4. Fibonacci: Generate the Fibbonaci Sequence as an infinite list.  The sequence starts with `0 : 1 :`, then after that each element is the sum of the two before that.  Note that you can't use a list comprehension for this, but you can use the awesome `zipWith` function.  Try using `zipWith (+)` to do pairwise sums on two lists.

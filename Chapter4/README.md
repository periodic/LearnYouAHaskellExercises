## 4. Syntax in Functions

1. Take the Fizz-Buzz question from chapter 2 and rewrite it using a function to transform numbers to strings.  Write it out using `if` syntax and guards.  Which did you like the best?
2. Take the `addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)` function from the chapter and rewrite moving the pattern matching to `let`, `where` and `case` expressions.  Why would you want to choose one over another?  Which is most readable?

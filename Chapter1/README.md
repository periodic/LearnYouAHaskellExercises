## 1. Introduction
â€‹
1. Explain "purely functional".  What does it mean for a language to be "purely functional"?  How does that differ from other languages?  Are there any other languages you know like this?  How similar is it to other languages you know?  What things would be easier or harder than in another language?
2. List some implications of lazy evaluation?  How does that differ from other programs?  How does that change how you think about programming?
3. The introduction mentioned something called referential transparency: "if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result."  In addition to reasoning about a program, what other benefits are there?  How does it affect testing, refactoring or architecture?
